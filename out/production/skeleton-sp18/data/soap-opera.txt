The story: Everyone knows about the love triangle involving Mars, Sun, and Venus, for both
Mars and Sun are in love with the beautiful Venus.  Mercury secretly loves Venus as well,
but does not dare to get involved with anything that would anger Sun, a powerful
politician, or Mars, a dangerous gang leader.  Sun loses interest in Venus, and it looks
for a while that Mars and Venus will be married.  Mercury, nearly hopeless, drifts off
alone.  But when Mars proposes to Venus, she realizes that she does not love him, and
finds a clever way to convince him that he does not want her, so they part ways very
quickly.  Venus now thinks she is alone, but Mercury is there to follow, and pursue his
love...
